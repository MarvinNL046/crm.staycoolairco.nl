-- Complete database inspection and safe cleanup script for testing
-- This script helps you see all data and safely clean it for testing

-- ========================================
-- PART 1: INSPECT ALL TABLES AND DATA
-- ========================================

-- 1. Show all tables with row counts
SELECT 
    '=== TABLE OVERVIEW WITH ROW COUNTS ===' as section;

SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables t WHERE t.table_name = pg_tables.tablename AND t.table_schema = pg_tables.schemaname) as exists,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- 2. Count rows in each table
SELECT 
    '=== ROW COUNTS PER TABLE ===' as section;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION count_all_tables()
RETURNS TABLE(table_name text, row_count bigint) AS $$
DECLARE
    r RECORD;
BEGIN

        SELECT tablename 
        FROM pg_tables 
        WHERE schemaname = 'public'

    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

SELECT * FROM count_all_tables() WHERE row_count > 0;

-- 3. Show table structure for main business tables
SELECT 
    '=== MAIN BUSINESS TABLES STRUCTURE ===' as section;

SELECT 
    t.table_name,
    STRING_AGG(
        c.column_name || ' (' || c.data_type ||

        'leads', 'contacts', 'customers', 'invoices', 'appointments', 
        'campaigns', 'deals', 'tasks', 'products', 'quotes'
    )
GROUP BY t.table_name
ORDER BY t.table_name;

-- 4. Show current tenant and users
SELECT 
    '=== CURRENT TENANTS ===' as section;
SELECT id, name, created_at FROM tenants;

SELECT 
    '=== CURRENT USERS ===' as section;
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.full_name,
    p.email,

-- PART 2: SAFE CLEANUP SCRIPT (COMMENT OUT UNTIL READY)
-- ========================================

-- This will DELETE all business data but keep the tenant and user structure

-- Delete in correct order to respect foreign keys
-- (Child tables first, then parent tables)

-- Communications

DELETE FROM sms_logs;
DELETE FROM call_logs;

-- Campaign related
DELETE FROM campaign_clicks;
DELETE FROM campaign_recipients;
DELETE FROM campaign_links;
DELETE FROM campaign_metrics;
DELETE FROM campaigns;

-- Invoice related
DELETE FROM invoice_items;
DELETE FROM invoices;

-- Appointment related
DELETE FROM appointment_reminders;

-- Workflow related
DELETE FROM workflow_executions;
DELETE FROM workflow_steps;

-- Automation related

-- Main business data

DELETE FROM contacts;
DELETE FROM customers;
DELETE FROM companies;
DELETE FROM products;

-- Other data
DELETE FROM activities;
DELETE FROM tags;
DELETE FROM expenses;

-- Keep these tables (user/tenant management):
-- tenants
-- profiles  
-- tenant_users
-- user_tenants
-- team_members
-- super_admins

-- Reset sequences for clean IDs (optional)
-- ALTER SEQUENCE leads_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
-- ALTER SEQUENCE contacts_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;

-- COMMIT;  -- Uncomment to actually execute
-- ROLLBACK; -- Or use this to test without applying changes

-- PART 3: QUICK DATA GENERATORS FOR TESTING
